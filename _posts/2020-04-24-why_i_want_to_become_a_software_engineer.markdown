Can I be real with you? I would’ve never imagined that I could make coding my passion, had I not have met the man I’m in love with and given birth to our son, the cutest little rascal (who dutifully runs around my house like a lush in drunken stupor!)

*No one:
A baby or a drunk: Aaaaahu boooowub wuuub, pleh… 
                                    Huwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.*

See, my only taste of coding was from back in the 8th grade, where we played around with a little CSS and HTML on some old iMac G3’s (*classsssic*), but let me tell you… A girl was #unimpressed and not encouraged to pursue it any further than required. And so it was relegated to the back of my mind like most things that don’t arouse a sense of joy in me, e.g. WW2 games or making my bed.

**BUT** with pregnancy, like most life changing events, came many startling realizations with humbling revelations, and a shift in priorities.

I need a career that provides my family the opportunity for a comfortable lifestyle, an outlet for creativity and a challenge. Entrepreneurship is also an aspiration of mine, so ideally those skills are transferable.

Some research, reflection and conversations with family and friends lead me back to something I never envisioned being a glamorous endeavor - coding.

I was taken back to my childhood. I imagine my Father probably had similar thoughts when he started our family. I grew up watching him progress in his career as a Network Engineer, He provided the stability, security and opportunities our family needed to thrive; which is exactly what I want the most for mine, and so much more. He looked ahead. He went into a field with no experience, a little curiosity and commitment to advance his lot in life.

I am my father's child. If he could conquer the challenges that were thrown at him, why couldn’t I? There’s no reason to doubt it. I signed myself up for the Software Engineering Boot camp at Flatiron School not really knowing what to expect. I felt it *all* - fear, excitement, wonder, and determination. I was going to take on one of the (seemingly) most challenging opportunities I’ve ever encountered. I was going to do it! ***I was all in.***

During my *First Mile*, which is essentially two weeks of intense information overload, I cycled through insecurity and confidence. Over and over again as I passed labs, and got stuck in them, I had those feelings of defeat and accomplishment. I learned to be a bit more resourceful, to trust that help was there if I needed it and that I am absolutely capable of learning to code. This experience alone reassured me I’ve made the right choice, and I look forward to my future as a Software Engineer.
