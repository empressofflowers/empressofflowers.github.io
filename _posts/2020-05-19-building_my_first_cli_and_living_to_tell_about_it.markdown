A few weeks ago, I began the Full Time-Online Software Engineering Bootcamp at Flatiron School, and it has been absolute, non-stop, madness (in a good way, of course). My days are spent weaving in and out of read-me’s, labs, and zoom meetings, to satisfying my one year old’s finger twiddling requests for milk, and occasionally alleviating my partner from baby duty, for a smoke break. It’s the best! I’m grateful. I truly am.

That’s not to say, that it can’t be hard sometimes to keep track of everything. I’ve found myself asking for help in both my personal life and in school life, more frequently than I’ve ever felt comfortable doing before; It’s been an adjustment. So I was feeling quite conflicted about how I was possibly going to complete this… in 7 days, given the circumstances.
The day before I got started, I had a chat with my education coach, whose gentle curiosity and words of encouragement (I’d need again mid-way through) helped settle my nerves. She reassured me that I am capable, that I’ve accomplished so much already, and how could it stop now? And I took her words with me, as she helped me re-discover what I needed to do to at least get started.

Create a vision and write it.

The excitement returned, and I began to really get a feel for how I wanted the program to function. I spent a day reviewing the New York Public Library: Digital Collections website. I chose to scrape their Posters collections to view in the command line. It should initiate with a greeting and propagate a list of the collections to the terminal. Upon choosing a collection, you are shown a list of it’s posters with a link to view it in the browser. I noted the objects I would need to create and their relationships, the gems I would need and how I intuitively felt the interface should flow. I was ready to hop to it, and so I did.

Doubt and the ills of perfectionism.

Have you ever had an idea about anything, maybe a car or dress… Something that you really wanted, that the mental image of it was so clear, as if it were right there physically with you? It’s perfect, without flaw. And then, when you finally get it, it’s better than anything you could’ve ever imagined? Well, that wasn’t the case here. I went a bit overkill in my expectations of what I, personally, could accomplish given a week to complete, because I’m a visionary who oftentimes neglects to fully consider the real world application of such.

Cue that second meeting with my educational coach annnnd add my mentor.

I was able to code out my objects, I got some help from some cohort mates with my scraper and was thoroughly enjoying designing the interface, until I got stuck… in an infinite loop… over and over again. While building my menu, I planned for the options to return to a previous collection, to return home, but most importantly, to be able to exit from anywhere in the program. I spent two days testing while loops with case statements, googling and more zoom meetings… to no avail. I’d get one part of my code working and another would break. What gives? My brain was done and I wanted to give up. BUT GOD, just kidding. I reached out to my mentor and my coach and expressed the emotional turmoil I was suffering and they really uplifted. I received some sound advice, a pat on the head, and a gentle push to keep trying. Who would’ve thought I needed that?

An improved perspective.

Back to the drawing board I went, with a much simpler goal in mind: to do exactly what I needed to build a sound project that performs as it’s expected to, with DRY code. Nothing fancy and I did just that. I got a little bit more help to get my scraper method to read a users input and it works! I did a bit of refactoring to make sure my code was readable, tweaked my readme, and committed it to Github.

Now that I can check this project off of my list, I’m not only relieved, but I’m taking with me a new found sense of appreciation for the meaning of teamwork, along with a healthy dose of courage and some key observations.
I can learn and apply it. Once I know what my goal is, I need to pause and make a plan. I can always ask for help. Be playfully curious. Plans can change, so be flexible and open to it. Most importantly, I’m a student Mom getting the opportunity to learn something new with a great support network, so I don’t have to beat myself up. I can enjoy the ride!
